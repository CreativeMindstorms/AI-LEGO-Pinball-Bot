# AI-LEGO-Pinball-Bot
Python code that runs a full PinBall experience, with 3 different ways to control the PinBall machine.

This is the code for my AI Lego Pinball machine, as seen on my YouTube channel:

## Introduction
The code involves 3 main codes for 3 different ways to control a Pinball machine. This includes manual, with a bot, and with AI. Furthermore, there are some modules to handle the robot and an HTML code for the scoreboard that is hosted locally.

## Credits
This project contains sounds that I did not produce.

The `game over.wav` file was downloaded from this YouTube video by "Sumit - FOXITOGO" (@foxitogoextra9418):\

I cannot find it elsewhere, but I'm not certain this was the original creator. Do notify me if you know the original creator.

The point scoring sounds are from Epidemic Sound.\

## Features
The project includes multiple features that work simultaneously.
- **Motorized Plunger:** Returns the ball to the field after draining.
- **Motorized Flippers:** Controlled with touch sensors.
- **Gameplay Mechanics:** Moving elements (spinning circle, trap door).
- **Scoring:** Color sensors sense the ball, scoring points and applying bonuses.
- **Tablet Score Display:** Displays scores and tracks high scores, also starts new games.
- **Vision System:** Camera tracks the ball and triggers game over when needed. Currently only works with color isolation.
- **Control:** There are three ways to control the machine:
  - **Manual Control:** Buttons control flippers for simple manual gameplay.
  - **Simple Bot:** Predicts ball movement and flips based on its position.
  - **Neural Network AI:** Learns to play in real-time by adjusting strategies using rewards and punishments (Reinforcement Learning).

## Installation
### Requirements
- Lego PinBall machine containing two LEGO Mindstorms EV3 kits
- Python 3 with libraries installed (see requirements.txt)
- Camera (e.g., phone with DroidCam or a webcam)
- Tablet / iPad with internet access
- Speaker
- Tested on a Windows 10 operating system.

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CreativeMindstorms/AI-LEGO-Pinball-Bot.git
2. Create a virtual environment and install the requirements.
3. Adjust variables inside the main code and modules, especially:
	`src/pinball_functions/ev3Functions.py` and `src/pinball_functions/cameraFunctions.py`
4. Warp your camera and adjust the hsv values for the ball by running `src/pinball_functions/cameraFunctions.py`

## Usage
Run any `src/main_*.py` after installation and configuration.

Visit the website that will be printed in the console to see the scoreboard.

## About The Machine
The machine uses two Mindstorms EV3 Bricks, of which you need the Bluetooth address.
